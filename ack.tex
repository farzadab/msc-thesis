\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my gratitude for those that have helped me throughout this journey. First, my supervisor, Michiel van de Panne, who has guided me at every step of the way. Your cheerful attitude is always motivating and the way you earnestly care for everyone around you is inspiring. I admire you, not just for your knowledge, but as a great human being.

Second, I would like to thank my lovely partner, Ainaz Hajimoradlu, for her unwavering love and support. Next in line are my colleagues who have helped me improve day by day: Glen Berseth, Hung Yu (Ben) Ling, Zhaoming Xie, Xue Bin (Jason) Peng, and Prashant Sachdeva.

Even more important, I would like to thank my family who have supported and encouraged me all my life. Particularly my mom and my aunt, Eshrat, without whose sacrifices I would not be here right now. Your love knows no bounds and I am forever grateful for all that you have given me.
