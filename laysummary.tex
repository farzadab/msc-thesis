\chapter{Lay Summary}

Reinforcement learning offers a flexible approach to learning locomotion skills for simulated characters. This work investigates two approaches that can make motions more realistic all the while having an equal or higher learning efficiency. We will explore ways to incorporate gait symmetry into the learning process as well as proposing a more appropriate way of enforcing torque limits on the simulated character.


% Using over-powered characters in simulation can help the learning. However, this can degrade the motion quality. We will propose a more appropriate way of enforcing torque limits on the simulated character without degrading the performance.

% On the other hand, able-bodied humans tend to have a fairly symmetric gait. We will explore methods that can incorporate this knowledge into the learning process.
